# os_lab_exam_5sem

Here is the solutions of all possible Operating Systems(os) lab question for 5th semester lab examination in Academy Of Technology. The questions are also attached with this repository. 
The questions are devided into two parts: one is from shellScript and another is from C-Coding.

## Shell Script
This is to demonstrate and implement basic linux commands.

A shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. Shell accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into something which the kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or starts the terminal.

A shell script has syntax just like any other programming language.As a shell can also take commands as input from file, we can write these commands in a file and can execute them in shell to avoid this repetitive work. These files are called Shell Scripts or Shell Programs. Shell scripts are similar to the batch file in MS-DOS. Each shell script is saved with `.sh` file extension e.g., myscript.sh.

### Setup for shell script
It's recommended to run the shell script in Linux.
save the file with `.sh` extension.
To run, go to terminal -> nevigate to your file's directory-> type the command: sh FileName.sh

## C-Coding
This section is mainly focused on implementation of fork system (parent-child process communication) , to understand the working of multilevel thread , and some classical Inter Process Communication(IPC) problems such that , dining-philosopher problem, readers-writer problem, producer-consumer problem.
